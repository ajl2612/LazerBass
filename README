In 2009, a man under the handle Jeff-o posted a project to a website named instructables.com. 
The project was a fully electric bass guitar without strings. 
Using a digital rangefinder, lasers and a circuit he designed, he was able to play music with 
some accuracy. Overall he considers the project a success, however he made note of some aspects 
of the design he would like improved in future revisions. We plan to pick up where this project left off, 
and further improve the concept in four major ways:

1. Replacing the digital rangefinder subsystem for determining pitch with a grid of tactile switches for increased accuracy. 
2. Converting the mostly analog circuit design to digital for reduced delay and cost
3. Provide chord functionality by adding additional oscillators per string. 
4. Addition of a microprocessor control subsystem to decrease delay between creating and hearing the sound. 

The team tasked with constructing this project will be composed of undergraduate RIT students from various backgrounds 
such as electrical, software and computer engineering. The current project leads are Caroline Lichtenberger; a 4th year 
Electrical engineer, and Andrew Lyne III; a 4th year Software and Electrical Engineering major. Professors from the  SE 
and CET departments have signed on as faculty advisors to ensure good design practices and functional product. Initial 
cost and time estimates can only be so accurate not knowing the exact components needed. Considering this, we estimate the 
project to cost approximately $500 and to completed approximately five months from approval with the overall goal of 
being completed in time for ImagineRIT.
